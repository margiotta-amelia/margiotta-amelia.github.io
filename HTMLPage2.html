            <h2>MIS 3353 - Databases Project ERD</h2>

            <p id="databases">
                This project has been one of the most difficult projects throughout
                <br />college so far, but also the most rewarding. I learned a lot
                <br />about how to create a database from scratch, how to upload
                <br />my own data, and how to create queries to pull the data I need.
                <br />The picture above represents the ERD my group and I created to
                <br />illustrate the relationships between the tables in our database.
                <br />It provided us a strong foundation for building the database.

            <h2>MIS 3033 - Graduation Handout WPF</h2>
            <p id="WPF">
                I really enjoy creating WPF applications because they allow room
                <br />for creativity and design. I like how flexible WPF is, making it
                <br />easy to build interactive and visually appealing applications.
                <br />This project was a lot different than MIS 3013 but I liked the
                <br />change and I think these skills are useful for in the future.
                <br />

            <h2>MIS 3033 - Personal HTML Website</h2>
            <p id="Web">
                This webpage that I created has been my favorite project so far
                <br />in this class. It's exciting to see my ideas come to life on
                <br />screen and to see the final product. There was lots of room
                <br />for me to add my own personal touch while still staying within
                <br />the guidelines of the assignment.
